Feature Flag - Confetti Background

To Use: Download contents of repository and open 'index.html' file in any browser.

The feature flag, labeled 'blue-squares' in my Launchdarkly account and in the file 'src/js/main.js' is enabled by default.

The background of the webpage has a confetti image as a background which is disabled when the feature flag is turned off either via the Javascript or via the web interface. 

Future Iteration: Use form for email validation and activate flag when a new user enters their email address.
